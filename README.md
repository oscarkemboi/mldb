The MBTI Database
This is a long-standing project since 2019 that focuses on the accurate identification of MBTI personality types, including visual identification.
The project uses machine learning, and community contribution via voting and the results are carefully filtered. All of the data in this repo is always available to be copied and used.
This is an open-source project, providing public data and API codes for the MBTI Database.
