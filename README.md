## The MBTI Database

The **MBTI Database** is a long-standing project, started in 2019, that focuses on the accurate identification of MBTI personality types, including visual identification.  

The project combines **machine learning techniques** with **community contributions via voting**, ensuring that results are carefully filtered for accuracy and reliability.  

All of the data in this repository is **open-source** and always available to be freely copied, used, and built upon.  

This project also provides **public data and API codes** for flexible integration into other applications or research projects.
